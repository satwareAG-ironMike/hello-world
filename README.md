# My Hello World Git Playground

**Repository Name**: `hello-world`

**Description**: This is my personal repository where I play around and experiment with various Git and GitHub features. Here, I challenge myself, make mistakes, learn, and try out new things without any constraints.

---

## Features & Why I Use Them:

1. **Practice Commits**: I use this space to perfect my commits, play around with different commit messages, and even amend or revert commits.
  
2. **Branching**: Here, I create, checkout, merge, and delete branches to understand their behavior.

3. **Merging & Rebasing**: I get to compare the effects of merging and rebasing, practicing both to see which suits my needs.

4. **Pull Requests**: I open pull requests, self-review my code, toy with draft PRs, and solve merge conflicts.

5. **GitHub Actions**: I'm delving into CI/CD, so I've set up basic GitHub Actions workflows here.

6. **GitHub Features**: I explore features like GitHub Pages and GitHub Discussions, and any new features GitHub rolls out.

7. **Git Submodules**: I occasionally add submodules to understand their intricacies.

8. **Issues & Projects**: I raise issues, link them to my PRs, and organize them using GitHub Projects just to see how they can be best utilized.

## My Personal Guidelines:

- **Experiment Freely**: Since this is my personal playground, I’m never afraid of making mistakes. That's how I learn.

- **Document**: I try to jot down key findings, either in the README or in a NOTES.md file. It’s great for referencing back.

- **Regular Cleanup**: I clean up old branches or past experiments from time to time, but always make sure I've captured the learnings.

## How I Dive In:

1. I clone this repository to my machine.
2. I start by creating a new branch for a particular experiment.
3. Then, I dive deep, making changes and learning along the way.
4. Once done, I commit and push to GitHub.
5. Often, I'll open a pull request to merge my changes into the main branch (or another branch), just to understand the process.
6. Reviewing, commenting, and merging become part of my self-review ritual.

This playground is where I grow, making it a testament to my journey with Git and GitHub.
